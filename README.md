# Implied Vol

Welcome to `implied-vol`, a lightning-fast, pure Rust implementation of Peter Jäckel's renowned implied volatility
calculations.

Originally found at [Peter Jäckel's homepage](http://www.jaeckel.org/), this library is a robust Rust reimplementation
of the pioneering work laid out in Jäckel's article, [Let's Be Rational](http://www.jaeckel.org/LetsBeRational.pdf).

Our aim is to offer a tool that provides blazingly fast and precise calculations of implied Black volatility.
With `implied-vol`, speed and accuracy in your quantitative finance projects need not be mutually exclusive.
